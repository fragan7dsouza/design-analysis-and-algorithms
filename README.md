# 📐 Design and Analysis of Algorithms (DAA) Programs

This repository contains a curated collection of algorithm implementations developed as part of my Design and Analysis of Algorithms (DAA) course. Each folder represents a specific algorithm written in C/C++, demonstrating core principles like searching, sorting, graph traversal, and string matching.

## 📂 Folder Structure

- `bfs` – Breadth-First Search graph traversal
- `binary_search` – Binary search in a sorted array
- `bubble_sort` – Classic bubble sort algorithm
- `dfs` – Depth-First Search graph traversal
- `knoyds` – Floyd’s Cycle Detection Algorithm (Tortoise and Hare)
- `heapsort` – Sorting using heap data structure
- `horspool` – Horspool's string matching algorithm
- `insertion_sort` – Simple insertion sort
- `merge_sort` – Divide and conquer merge sort
- `quick_sort` – Efficient quicksort algorithm
- `selection_sort` – Basic selection sort
- `sequential_search[s]` – Linear/sequential search method
- `string_matching` – Pattern matching logic in strings
- `topological` – Topological sort for directed acyclic graphs
- `warshalls` – Warshall's algorithm for transitive closure

## 🛠️ How to Run

1. Clone the repository  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/fragan7dsouza/daa-programs.git
   ```
2. Navigate into a folder and compile the `.c` or `.cpp` file  
   ```bash
   gcc program.c -o output
   ./output
   ```
   or for C++:
   ```bash
   g++ program.cpp -o output
   ./output
   ```
